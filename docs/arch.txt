Based on the project requirements from the provided case document, the architecture for your data transformation, model training, and online scoring system using AWS services would look something like this:
1. Data Ingestion and Transformation (ETL)

    Amazon S3: Use S3 to store raw flight data and external datasets (from APIs like Weatherbit and AirportDB).
    AWS Glue or EMR with PySpark: Since you are using PySpark for transformations, you can use AWS Glue (a fully managed ETL service) or EMR to run PySpark jobs to transform and enrich the flight data. This handles the transformation part of the ETL process.
    AWS Lambda (optional): For lightweight transformations, you can trigger AWS Lambda to enrich or clean data streams if needed.

2. Model Training

    Amazon SageMaker: SageMaker is ideal for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It allows you to:
        Run your training notebooks (from the /notebook folder).
        Split the dataset into training and testing sets, manage the entire ML pipeline, and save models as .pkl files.
        Use SageMaker to automate hyperparameter tuning, version models, and manage metrics.

3. Online Prediction API

    Amazon API Gateway: Expose RESTful API endpoints (like /model/predict/, /model/load/, /model/history/, /health/).
    AWS Lambda: Use Lambda functions behind API Gateway to handle online prediction requests. Lambda can load the saved ML model (.pkl file from S3 or SageMaker) and use it for predictions.
    Amazon DynamoDB: Store the history of predictions, including input payloads and prediction outputs, in DynamoDB for quick retrieval.

4. Model Storage and Management

    Amazon S3: Store the trained model files (.pkl) and load them when needed through the /model/load/ endpoint.
    SageMaker Hosting Services (optional): You can also host the model directly in SageMaker endpoints for real-time inference instead of loading .pkl files manually.

5. Monitoring and Logging

    Amazon CloudWatch: Set up CloudWatch for logging and monitoring your API, Lambda functions, and SageMaker jobs. This also helps in monitoring the health of the system via the /health/ endpoint.
    AWS X-Ray: Use X-Ray for tracing requests through API Gateway and Lambda to ensure performance bottlenecks are caught early.

High-Level AWS Architecture:

    Data Sources (Flight data, Weatherbit API, AirportDB API)
    Amazon S3 (Raw data storage)
    AWS Glue / EMR with PySpark (Data transformation)
    Amazon S3 (Processed data storage)
    Amazon SageMaker (Model training and .pkl model storage)
    Amazon API Gateway + AWS Lambda (Serving predictions)
    Amazon DynamoDB (Storing prediction history)
    Amazon CloudWatch (Monitoring and logging)

This setup leverages fully managed services to minimize infrastructure management while allowing scalability and real-time predictions.
